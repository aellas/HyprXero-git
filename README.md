# This is XeroLinux's Hyprland Layan Rice

### Disclaimer

I would like to clarify one very important aspect of ricing. We use custom themes, and those might not get updated very often, if at all by their respective developers/artists, which might result in some parts of the system and apps not to get themed correctly. That, my friends, is unfortunately out of our hands.

### ❤️‍🔥 Credits

This project was a real labor of love, built with the help of two **Legendary** people I’ve come to respect: [**@Array**](hhttps://github.com/aellas){:target="_blank"} (Config) and [**DDubs**](https://github.com/dwilliam62){:target="_blank"} (Advisor). Their input and support were crucial at every step, and without their contributions, this wouldn’t have come together the way it did. I’m glad to have worked with them on this. I just created the install script 😇
